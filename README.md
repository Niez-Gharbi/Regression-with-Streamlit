* The frontend is designed with user-friendly interfaces to ensure a seamless user experience. 👩‍💻👨‍💻

Many models trained with randomly prepared historical data predicted the next 365 data points.

On the last page, the performances of these  models were compared and the best model was plotted.

To run the streamlit app, run :
```
cd src
streamlit run app.py
```

Next Steps:

* Deployment
* Selectable test period
